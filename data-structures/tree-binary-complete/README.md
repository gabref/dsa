# Complete Binary Tree

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.

A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences

1. All the leaf eleemnts must lean towards the left
2. The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to a full binary tree
